# Processing JS Projects

This is a collection of a bunch of cool projects I made while I was learning to code on Khan Academy.

## Running the code

If you want to run these yourself, you have two options:

1. Use KhanAcademy's built in Processing JS code

You can just copy paste the code into here, this is the simplest way.

2. Add JS to HTML

Download the processing-template.html file
Copy and paste the contents of the js file you want after the frameRate(60) line.
If needed, edit the size(400, 400) line
Open the HTML!
